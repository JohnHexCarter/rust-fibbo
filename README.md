# Fibbo

This is a simple Fibonacci value calculator while learning Rust.
This is the "homework" from [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

Currently it only supports up to the 47th value of the Fibonacci sequence and handles that in user input
to ensure no panics. Future expansion could include expanding the support to higher values and updating
the user input protection.
